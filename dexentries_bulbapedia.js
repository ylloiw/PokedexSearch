    "Moon": "They often gather near places frequented by electric Pokémon in order to avoid being attacked by bird Pokémon.",
    "Ultra Sun": "If you find its nest, you shouldn't stick your hand inside. You'll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin.",
    "Ultra Moon": "It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down.",
    "Sword": "Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches.",
    "Shield": "It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."
  },
  "Charjabug": {
    "Sun": "Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around.",
    "Moon": "From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac.",
    "Ultra Sun": "It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you'll get a shock!",
    "Ultra Moon": "Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents.",
    "Sword": "While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws.",

  },
  "Vikavolt": {
    "Sun": "It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening. It concentrates electrical energy within its large jaws and uses it to zap its enemies.",
    "Moon": "It produces electricity via an electrical organ in its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with shocking beams of electrical energy.",
    "Ultra Sun": "It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity.",

    "Moon": "It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious.",
    "Ultra Sun": "Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches.",

    "Ultra Sun": "It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!",

    "Moon": "Some of Ribombee's pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements.",
    "Ultra Sun": "Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still.",

    "Moon": "This Pokémon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its Trainer's side.",
    "Ultra Sun": "As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them.",
    "Ultra Moon": "When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you, that's proof of its love for you. However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!",

    "Ultra Sun 1": "Wishiwashi assemble in this formation to face off against strong foes. It boasts a strength that earned it the name “demon of the sea.”",
    "Ultra Moon 1": "Called “demon of the sea” by some, when Wishiwashi are injured in battle and their numbers dwindle, they become a regular school.",
    "Sword": "Individually, they're incredibly weak. It's by gathering up into schools that they're able to confront opponents.",
    "Shield": "When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather.",
    "Sword 1": "On their own, they're very weak. But when Wishiwashi pool their power together in a school, they become a demon of the sea.",
    "Shield 1": "When facing tough opponents, they get into formation. But if they get wounded in battle, they'll scatter and become solitary again."

    "Ultra Sun": "The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.",

    "Sword 1": "This form of Lycanroc is reckless. It charges headlong at its opponents, attacking without any care about what injuries it might receive.",
    "Shield 1": "It's invigorated by powerful opponents–the stronger the better. A full-force headbutt from one of these Lycanroc can shatter giant boulders.",
    "Sword  2": "This form of Lycanroc is normally calm and quiet. Once a battle begins, however, this Pokémon displays a ferocious fighting spirit.",
    "Shield  2": "These Pokémon have both calm and ferocious qualities. Their temperamental nature makes them a difficult species to raise."

    "Sun": "It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles.",
    "Moon": "It's found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola's head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon.",
    "Ultra Sun": "They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off.",
    "Ultra Moon": "Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they're cut off. After a good night's sleep, Mareanie is back to normal.",
    "Sword": "The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it's impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.",

    "Ultra Sun": "To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet.",
    "Ultra Moon": "With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn't affect Toxapex in there, so it's very comfortable.",
    "Sword": "To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat.",

    "Moon": "When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them.",
    "Ultra Sun": "When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other's way.",
    "Ultra Moon": "It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land.",
    "Sword": "It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes.",
